We follow the Drupal coding standards with the following added requirements.

Naming conventions
==================

 * Hooks: Only hooks will be named "module_XXX", with the following exceptions:

   o Pages callbacks will be named "module_XXX_page"

   o Form callbacks will be named "module_XXX_form"

   o Submit callbacks will be named "module_XXX_form_submit"

   o Functions to invoke hooks will be named "module_XXX_invoke"

   o A settings class (if necessary) will be called "module_settings"

 * Theme functions: will be named "theme_module_XXX"

 * API functions intended to be called by other modules, will be part of a class
   with the same name as the module.
 
 * All other functions are considered internal, and will be named '_module_XXX', including:

   o Access callbacks (like returned from hook_menu)

Files
=====

 * .module file should contain only:
 
   o hooks
   o require statements
   o internal functions

 * module.admin.inc should contain form or page callbacks for admin pages

 * module.theme.inc should contain all theme functions

 * module.pages.inc should contain all (non-admin) menu and form callbacks

 * module.api.inc should contain all the API functions (including the definition
   of the settings class, if there is one)

If there is a public API, then the .module file must require it, as one of the first
things it does.

Loading includes
================

If we load includes that are contained under our control, they should always be loaded
via require_once(dirname(__FILE__) .'/filename.inc').

If we load includes from another module, we should use module_load_include() -- BUT
we can't use this at the global level, only inside of a function.
