A commercial product for decrypting SWF applications with valid licenses:

Ideas for how our application could work:

 (*) There is a wrapper application, which downloads the actual application and runs it.  The
     actual application would exist in a number of random variants for deobfuscating the messages
     which come from the server.  The variants would have to be generated automatically on the
     server at a particular internal (every hour?) and rotated frequently during the user
     process.

 (*) For version 1.0 of this, we will be working primarily on obscurity (both of our product,
     but also the works included) so I don't think we will need to worry as much as the above
     point.  So, I say it works like this:

       - There is a wrapper application, which has a public key for the server.  Using this
         public key, it can send many things "for the server's eyes only".  Everything will
         be sent to a single SSL end-point on the server (https://secure.lingwo.org/XXX-product-key).

       A. The wrapper logs into the server with the users credentials.  The server returns a
          special format packet, with the real SWF application, an encryption key to 
          decrypt it (AES maybe) and a session id.
    
       B. The real application starts up and has use of the same server public key and the
          session id.  It then requests an encryption key for decrypting the content.  All
          requests from this point on will be sent to the same end-point, in a special format
          for the server encrypted with the server public key, and results will be returned
          in the content encryption key.
       
       - Both the flash applications will be obfuscated as much as possible via some commericial
         product.
    
       - Our security (by obscurity) will come from the special format in which things are passed
         between the client and server.  This should be good enough until there is enough attention
         on the site or its content.

       - The content would initially exist in the database as some series of nodes, but be hidden
         away so users can't get it.  A cronjob would pull the content from the database, put it into
         encrypted files on disk and stash the encryption key somewhere.  This key would be
         occasionally rotated.

       - Step 1 in this is writting the actual application, which has the server public key (RSA)
         and the content encryption key (AES) and can use the secure end-point to load and display
         content in a way that can't be copy-pasted, with a small enough frame to make OCR
         impractical and with network communications that can't be 3rd party sniffed to determine
         the content of the work.
