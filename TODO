 * Add a settings page where we can select which content type is the "entry" type and which
   taxonomy vocabulary will represent the "Part of Speech" field.

 * Hi-jack the node edit form for the "entry" type, remove the "Language neutral" option and
   (possibly) force the default to be the current language.
  
 * Hi-jack the node edit form for the "entry" type and force the "Part of Speech" taxonomy
   selection to be the same as the entries original, if it is a translation.  (NOTE: actually,
   we could do this with the translaion synchronization!  Because we want all taxonomy -- including
   tags -- to be synchronized).

 * Hi-jack the node edit form for the "entry" type and make it so that "title" and "Part of Speech"
   cannot be changed when editting an existing node.  (NOTE: we should attempt to validate this
   in some save or validate hook as well!)

 * Hi-jack the node edit form for the "entry" type and make sure that the title is made to be
   something special when the "entry" is a translation, ie. remain the same as the original or
   maybe be a combination of the original title and the translation language.  This is to lessen
   confusion between translations and originals.
 
 * Hi-jack node save (or some validate hook?) and make sure that entries are unique by language,
   pos and title, add new nodes to the lingwo_dictionary_entry table.
 
 * Work on managing the multiple values of "senses" in the module itself, rather than letting
   core handle that.

 * Make the seperate forms for the "senses" field when an entry is a translation and when it is
   an original.

 * Get searching and looking up definitions alot tighter (meaning easier to use for the end
   user).

 * Figure out proper 404 behaviour.

 * Figure out a good way to do the title on the translation view/edit pages.

 * Figure out a good way to link back to the entry from the translation view/edit pages.
 
 * Seperate the word translation from the "note" (ie. some info to go into paranthesis,
   or maybe just use convention, which is, if they write anything in parantheses?).  Or
   maybe the reverse, that either the whole thing is the word, or the contents of [brackets]
   are.  So, then the English translation of "szkolny", would be "pertaining to [school:noun]".
   Putting ":noun" is necessary because "szkolny" is an adjective, so it would default to link
   to "[school:adjective]".
 
 * Add the "Same as" selector on translation senses, so that senses can be consolidated.

 * Finish up "/languages":
   
   - Add a search bit, where we can try and find a language from keywords (fuzzily!)
     and the language code.
