 * Try and fix AHAH!  There are so many weird issues with it I'm not sure what to do..

 * Remove 'weight' and 'remove_sense' from each sense before it is saved.

 * Make it so that we could use either the normal taxonomy form stuff or a content_taxonomy
   CCK field.  (Ie. it needs to disable it correctly).

 * Hi-jack the node edit form for the "entry" type and MAYBE make the language be the default
   language.
  
 * Use some validate hook to validate that "title", "language" and "Part of Speech" can't be 
   changed on an existing node or on a translation.

 * Hi-jack node save (or some validate hook?) and make sure that entries are unique by language,
   pos and title, add new nodes to the lingwo_dictionary_entry table.

 * Get searching and looking up definitions alot tighter (meaning easier to use for the end
   user).

 * Figure out proper 404 behaviour.

 * Figure out a good way to do the title on the translation view/edit pages.

 * Figure out a good way to link back to the entry from the translation view/edit pages.
 
 * Seperate the word translation from the "note" (ie. some info to go into paranthesis,
   or maybe just use convention, which is, if they write anything in parantheses?).  Or
   maybe the reverse, that either the whole thing is the word, or the contents of [brackets]
   are.  So, then the English translation of "szkolny", would be "pertaining to [school:noun]".
   Putting ":noun" is necessary because "szkolny" is an adjective, so it would default to link
   to "[school:adjective]".
 
 * Add the "Same as" selector on translation senses, so that senses can be consolidated.

 * Finish up "/languages":
   
   - Add a search bit, where we can try and find a language from keywords (fuzzily!)
     and the language code.
