In the future, language definitions will live in the database.  Before we can do that, however, we
need a decent browser-based development environment (a sane editor) as well as a way to pull the
files into a local text editor (WebDAV?  Blogger API?).

Since we aren't allowing users to create language definitions just yet anyway, we will keep these
here for now.
