 * Rearrange the code:

   - We need an Entry object, to hold the entry in progress.  This is what will eventually be passed
     to the remote server.

   - Each source (ie. pl.wiktionary.org) will get its own file.  Here it will declare a handler that
     will split out the required language, run a language specific parser over it, and pass the resulting
     entry on to another handler.

   - We will have a CombineSources function, that will load up all the sources and run a handler over
     them which stashes the Entries in the database as follows:

       {
         // Minimal top-level entry stuff
         language: '...',
         pos: '...',
         headword: '...',

         // Here we will stash the info from the different sources/parsers
         sources: {
           'pl.wiktionary.org': {
             'raw': '...', // The original wikitext data
             'parsed': '...', // The entry from the parser, but w/o the 'sources' data
             'date': new Date(), // A date object representing when the data was dumped
           },
           'en.wikitionary.org': { ... }
         }
       }

   - Then we would run over this database using the ultimate "PolishHandler" that will combine the data
     from both sources and pass the result to the server over remote.

 * Implement the last "full cycle" feature of the importer, which is the remote/service stuff.  We
   should atleast put the entries into the database as Node's, even if its not done in the way we
   will do it in the end.
 
 * Start getting serious about doing some importing!!
