 * Implement a DatabaseProducer which walks a database and throws up the individual entries
   to the handler.

 * Change the Producer.run() interface to take an object of arguments, because we may want to expand
   this arbitrarily for different producers.  Maybe Handler.process() too.
 
 * Implement the last "full cycle" feature of the importer, which is the remote/service stuff.  We
   should atleast put the entries into the database as Node's, even if its not done in the way we
   will do it in the end.
 
 * Get a dump of the Polish wikipedia and atleast split it into a SQLite db of just the Polish
   entries, so that we can get an idea of the counts.
 
 * Start getting serious about doing some importing!!
