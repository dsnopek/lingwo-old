<p>As a standard part of their upbringing, our grandparents had to recite poems by heart and know historical facts off the top of their heads.  Today, memorization is no longer as valued.  Because we are less used to it, committing facts to memory is harder for us.</p>

<p>This is where mnemonic devices help.  For example, one of the very best mnemonics is using the first letter of each word to create a phrase.  Take the biological taxonomy of Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus and Species.  To fix this in your mind you might use the phrase, "Kids Prefer Cheese Over Fried Green Spinach."  Or, for the planets from the Sun out, "My Very Elegant Mother Just Served Us Nuts."</p>

<p>Mnemonic devices like songs, rhymes, and phrases work because they siphon off much of the work of relationship and sequence onto simpler phrases or like sounds, freeing up more of the mind's energy for the remaining information.  So next time you have a list to memorize, try coming up with a mnemonic.</p>
