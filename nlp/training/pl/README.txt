These texts were all downloaded from Project Gutenburg:

 * szachy_i_warcaby.txt:  http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15201
 * sherlock_holmes.txt:   http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34079
 * pan_tadeusz.txt:       http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31536

Then modified in the following ways:

 * All English text was removed (unfortunately, this includes the license information
   from Project Gutenburg.  However, since these files are being used to linguistic
   analysis pursposes, I think this is OK)
 
 * Things which could distrupt processing were removed.  So far:

   - The "_" character, which is used mainly to indicate emphasized text (bold, italic)
     was removed.
