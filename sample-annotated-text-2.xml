<p>Many studies involving adopted children now seem to show that parental involvement has almost no effect on such things as future IQ.  Although parents who were very involved helped improve the reading and math scores of both their adopted and biological children about equally early on, this effect seemed fade at puberty.  As adopted children entered their teens, their test scores seemed to become less and less similar to their adoptive parents' scores.  By the time they got to college, adopted children had no more connection to their adoptive parent's IQ's than total strangers.  Grownup biological children, however, had about the same IQ's as their parents.</p>

<p>So maybe at the next Oscars, instead of thanking their parent's lessons, they should thank the their genes.  "Oh yeah, and I can't forget to thank the genes for my IQ and great looks.  Without you I wouldn't be here!"</p>
