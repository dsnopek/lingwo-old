A Better Way to Learn Languages

<p>Although foreign language study has been a topic of university level study for over a hundred years, there is still a great deal of dispute over what is the best method of teaching languages.  The classic foreign language learning approach of “skill and drill” remains one of the most popular.  Even in courses taught completely in the subject language, the emphasis is still on learning particular grammar rules that instructors can build tests around.  </p>

<p>Newer theories, however, have sought to make language acquisition a more natural practice.  Comprehensible Input Theory, for example, argues that language acquisition should move along the same tracks that learners used when acquiring their first languages.  No one would make the case that toddlers should memorize verb forms when learning to speak.  So why do we think older students would learn this way?</p>

 <p>The Comprehensible Input ideal is a low-stress learning environment where students interact naturally with one another and the instructor.  Rather than choosing examples of particular grammatical patterns, instructors choose language samples geared to capturing student interest.  Often these samples will be more difficult than those in a classic language classroom.  Because students focus on meaning instead of structure, however, they are able to stretch their language ability.  In this way, they grow into more competent and confident users of the target language.</p>
