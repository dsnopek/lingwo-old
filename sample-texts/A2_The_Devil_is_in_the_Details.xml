The Devil is in the Details

<p>Sometimes opportunities that seem great in the abstract are unbearable when rendered into concrete detail.  Take this scenario, for example: A biologist discovers a substance that will allow you to live for 200 years.</p> 

<p>Most of us would jump at the chance to live for two centuries.  What if, however, you had to live inside of a germ-free room from age thirty on without any direct human contact?  You would have books, and television, and especially made food, but friends and family would only be able to communicate with you via computer screens.</p>

<p>Or, let's say you still aged pretty much like we do now.  Even though you would live longer, in your second century of life your spine would curve, your vision would dim, your hearing fail, and you would have all the pains and frailty that the elderly have normally.  For a hundred years you would hobble about on arthritic joints, a prisoner to your wasting body.</p>

<p>So next time someone makes you an offer that seems too good to be true, look carefully at the fine print.  The Devil is in the details!</p>
