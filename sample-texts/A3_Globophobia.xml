A Phobia for Everyone

<p>When you were a kid, you might have been afraid of things that go bump in the night.  But what about things that go "pop"?</p>

<p>Believe it or not, some people are terrified of balloons.  Globophobia, as psychologists term it, usually stems from a bad childhood experience with a popping balloon.</p>

<p>Think that's strange?  Psychologists have a name for just about every phobia you can imagine.  For example, some people suffer from coulrophobia, the fear of clowns, while others, pupaphobes, fear puppets.  Those who suffer from consecotaleophobia are afraid of manipulating chopsticks, while those who suffer from anablephobia are afraid of looking up. And here's one that will keep on your feet: kathisophobia, the fear of sitting.</p>

<p>Psychologists have unique names for fears of individual numbers and each letter of the alphabet. And clearly a sadist coined the fear of long words:  hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia.</p>
