
Do You Believe in Angels?

<p>Although the United States is often thought of as the center of consumerism and worldly, materialistic values, Americans don't really picture themselves this way.  In fact, a significant portion of the American population sees the United States as God's chosen people, a nation blessed by divine providence.  Historians trace these beliefs all the way back to the nation's Puritan Forefathers.</p> 

<p>Take the following surveys.  Polls show that more than 90% of Americans profess a faith in God or some controlling Spiritual Force.  Three quarters of Americans believe in Heaven (though only just over half believe in Hell).  Four fifths believe that miracles actually occur.  About two out of three believe that their Holy Book is the literal word of God and the same amount believe in the existence of unseen beings that watch over them--angels!</p>    

<p>This religious tendency is so interwoven in the American fabric that no serious candidate for president can afford to be smeared as an atheist.  Of the 44 presidents, only Kennedy was not a Protestant (Catholic) and it almost cost him his election.</p>
