God vs. Darwin

<p>A healthy slice of the American public, who identify themselves as Fundamentalist Christians, view aspects of science as a threat to what they see as the religious and moral underpinnings of American society.  In 2005, Fundamentalists took over the Kansas board of education and urged that Intelligent Design be taught as part of the High School curriculum on Evolution.</p>

<p>The scientific community was up in arms!  To High School science teachers, the board's proclamation trespassed on the integrity of their classrooms and they vowed to doggedly oppose any changes.  The wider scientific community also saw these developments as bad omens for American education.  Scientists were loathe to give equal voice to pseudo-scientific hypotheses like Intelligent Design, fearing that giving these views such a prominent stage would undermine the Scientific Method and be used as fodder by those who want to foment the impression of there being two warring camps when it comes to Evolution. </p>

<p>In 2007, with the Fundamentalists routed from the board in elections the year before, scientific standards were restored.</p>
