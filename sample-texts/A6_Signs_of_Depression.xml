Signs of Depression

<p>One in five teens suffer at least one bout of depression.  At any moment, one in twenty teens are undergoing a serious, long term depression.  On average, a depressive episodes last 8 months.</p>

<p>Typically, depressed teens are overcome by a sadness they can’t shake.  They think no one cares about them and that no one would miss them if they vanished. Things to them seem not to matter, and they may even feel like ending it all.</p>

<p>On the other hand, depressed teens are just as likely to be short tempered with friends and not be able to stop their thoughts from running them ragged at night.  Often they won’t be able to sit still and their grades will take a dive because studying becomes too much of an effort. 

<p>Depression even shows up as a cluster of physical symptoms.  Inability to sleep, feeling worn out, and loss of appetite (or binging on junk foods) are all signs of depression.  So too is withdrawing from friends and family.</p>

<p>If you or a friend shows these symptoms tell a parent or teacher.  Depression can be overcome. </p>
