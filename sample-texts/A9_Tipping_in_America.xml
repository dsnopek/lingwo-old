Tipping: East and West

<p>With the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the apparent triumph of Capitalism around the world, you might expect monetary practices to follow suite.  However, when we look at a practice like tipping, we see that cultural and political values still play a significant role.</p>

<p>In the West, tipping after a meal at a restaurant is usually expected.  In fact, in countries like France, "tipping" is law and the state requires restaurants to figure it as part of the cost of the meal on the menu.  Extra tipping above the 15% mandated by law remains an option for superb service.<p> 

<p>In the United States tipping is a deeply ingrained cultural practice but no law requires it.  However, many states allow restaurant owners to pay waiters below the state and federal minimum wage, in expectation that waiters will garner at least 10% of the sales on the tables they service.  Much of these earnings go untaxed since waiters, as a matter of course, underreport their cash earnings when filing their tax forms.</p> 

<p>In the East, waiters not only don't receive tips, they may see it as an insult.  In Japan, for example, restaurants pay an adequate wage.  When Westerners leave tips, Japanese waiters perceive this as an act of charity that implies a feeling of Western superiority and ignorance, and is thus insulting.  In China, similarly, tipping was actually illegal until the 1980's.<p>

<p>Given these variations in cultural practices, it is not surprising how often you hear stories of Westerners leaving tips only to have East Asian waiters chase after them to return their abandoned money!<p>
